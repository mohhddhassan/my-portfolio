  description: "I am Mohamed Hussain, a passionate and curious data engineer currently interning at Quantrail Data, where I work with ClickHouse and build scalable data pipelines. I love working across the data stack â€” from efficient SQL to Python-based system optimization. I've built a real-time analytics dashboard to track ingestion and query performance, gaining hands-on experience in system observability. I enjoy creating impactful tools like AutoTrend for demand prediction and web apps like MedRem and EduTrack in healthcare and productivity domains. I thrive in fast-paced environments like hackathons and value clean code, smart solutions, and continuous learning. I'm open to exciting opportunities where I can grow and build things that matter. ðŸš€",
